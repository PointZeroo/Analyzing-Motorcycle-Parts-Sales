## Introduction
This project analyzes sales data from a motorcycle parts company operating three warehouses (North, Central, and West).  
The focus is on calculating **net revenue from wholesale orders**, broken down by product line, month, and warehouse.

## Dataset Description
The dataset is stored in a PostgreSQL database containing one main table: **sales**.

## Objective
The goal is to calculate:  
- **Wholesale net revenue** for each product line  
- Grouped by **month** and **warehouse**  
- Sorted by product line, month, and descending net revenue 

---

## Queries Overview
1. EXTRACT the month from date `column`.  
2. Filter orders where `client_type = 'Wholesale'`.  
3. Group data by product_line, month, and warehouse.  
4. Calculate `net_revenue` as total minus payment fees.  
5. Sort results by product_line, month, and net revenue (descending).

## Visualization and Analysis

To better understand the data, visualizations were created:

3. **Warehouse Comparison**  
   - A stacked bar chart comparing revenues across the three warehouses.

**Analysis:**  
- Frame and Body has the highest net revenue (39,477.51 USD), followed by Suspension and Traction (38,294.76 USD).
- August had the highest sales overall, particularly in engine parts.  
- Central warehouse recorded the highest sales.  
  

---

## Results and Insights
- The query returns wholesale net revenue by product line, month, and warehouse.
- This helps identify which product lines drive the most revenue and in which warehouse and month.
- Key insights can guide decisions such as:
  - Optimizing warehouse distribution
  - Adjusting product stock levels
  - Monitoring seasonal revenue trends

---

## Future Work
- Extend the analysis to include retail clients and compare with wholesale trends.
- Incorporate payment method impact to evaluate cost efficiency.
- Develop dashboards (Power BI, Tableau) for real-time revenue monitoring.
- Apply forecasting models (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet) to predict future sales patterns.
